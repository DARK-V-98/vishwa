    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support user authentication, profile management, and administrative roles, focusing on security, scalability, and debuggability. It incorporates key principles such as Authorization Independence, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and Structural Segregation to streamline security rules and maintain data integrity.\n\n*   **Authorization Independence:** The `users/{userId}` collection includes the `profileId` field. While seemingly creating a `get()` dependency, the intended use-case is to simply store the ID. Access to `/users/{userId}/profile` is granted via path-based ownership, eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules.\n*   **Structural Segregation:** User profiles and admin roles are stored in separate collections (`userProfiles` and `roles_admin`), ensuring different security postures for each. This segregation simplifies rules and avoids mixing data with varying access requirements.\n*   **DBAC:** Admin roles are managed through the `roles_admin/{uid}` collection. The existence of a document for a user in this collection grants admin privileges, enabling simple existence-based security rules.\n*   **QAPs:** `list` operations are secured by enforcing ownership and role-based access controls. Path-based ownership (`users/{userId}`) allows listing only resources owned by the authenticated user. Admin role checks in the `roles_admin` collection authorize administrative `list` operations.\n\nThis structure facilitates secure and efficient data access while adhering to core design principles, minimizing complexity and maximizing debuggability."
