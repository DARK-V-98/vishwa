/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data and allows public read access for service and product listings.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in the `/users/{userId}` collection.
 * - User-specific data (design orders, appointments, quotation requests) are stored in subcollections under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Services and products are stored in the top-level collections `/services` and `/products`, respectively.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles and related data are strictly accessible only to the owning user.
 * - Service listings are publicly readable.
 * - Product listings are publicly readable, but only the seller can modify them.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `DesignOrder`, `Appointment`, and `QuotationRequest` entities all have a `userId` field, which is used for path-based ownership validation.
 * - The `Product` entity has a `sellerId` field, which is used for owner-only writes.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data is segregated into subcollections under `/users/{userId}`, enabling secure and efficient listing of user-owned resources.
