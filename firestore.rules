/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data
 * (design orders, appointments, quotation requests), ensuring that only the
 * authenticated user who owns the data can create, read, update, or delete it.
 * Public data (services) is readable by anyone but writable only with appropriate authorization (not implemented in this prototyping ruleset).
 * Product listings are readable by anyone, but only the seller can modify them.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/designOrders/{designOrderId}: Stores design orders for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointments for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/quotationRequests/{quotationRequestId}: Stores quotation requests for a specific user.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: Stores company services.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product listings with a 'sellerId' field indicating ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly allowed via the `get` and `list` rules on `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Services are publicly readable but require additional authorization to modify (not implemented here).
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for design orders, appointments, and quotation requests.
 * - Products can be read by anyone but only modified by the seller.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Products have a `sellerId` field, which is used to determine ownership and authorize modifications. This avoids needing a separate query to determine ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data is stored in subcollections under the `/users/{userId}` path. This structural segregation is used to enforce strict ownership and simplify rules.
