/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private data and allows public read access for certain collections like "services" and "products". User-specific data is stored under the /users/{userId} path.
 * @dataStructure The database is structured with top-level collections for `users`, `services`, and `products`. User-specific data (designOrders, appointments, quotationRequests) is stored in subcollections under each user's document.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *   - Read access is public for the `services` and `products` collections.
 *   - Write access to `products` is restricted to the owner (seller). The `products` documents have an `sellerId` field for owner validation.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization The `products` collection uses the `sellerId` field to denormalize ownership, enabling secure write rules without additional `get()` calls.
 * @structuralSegregation User-specific data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring clear separation of private data.
