/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data and
 * allows public read access to service and product listings.  All write
 * operations require authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - User-specific data (design orders, appointments, quotation requests)
 *   are stored in subcollections under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Services and Products are stored in top-level collections (`/services`, `/products`).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own profile and
 *   associated data.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Services are publicly readable.
 * - Products are publicly readable, but write access is restricted to the owner (seller).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Products have a `sellerId` field to enable owner-based write restrictions.
